SKELETON ONLY - not implemented yet.

A reference-tone generator for OVOS - 'give me an A' plays a 440Hz tone (or any named musical note/frequency), useful for tuning instruments offline. Generated sine tone, no audio samples needed.

See README.md ("Why this exists") and DEVELOPMENT.md ("Design notes")
before starting real implementation - several open design questions
are noted there and should be resolved (ideally reviewed) before
writing the real intent logic, same process ovos-skill-convert and
ovos-skill-sound-like followed.
